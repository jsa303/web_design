            <h2>Pick 1: Chelsea v Shamrock Rovers</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose BTTS <emp>no</emp> @1.73</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chelsea play in the Premier League and Shamrock Rovers play in the Irish Premier Division.
                        </li>
                        <li>Chelsea have won 5 games out of 5 in the UEFA Conference League.</li>
                        <li>Although Chelsea have conceded in 3 of the last 5 UEFA Conference League games to the likes
                            of Gent, Panathinaikos and Astana.</li>
                        <li>Shamrock have only played against weaker opposition: TNS, Rapid Wien, and Borac Banja Luka.
                        </li>
                        <li>I believe that a weaker Chelsea team will be too strong for Shamrock Rovers and can see
                            Shamrock Rovers succumbing to the pressure of playing at Stamford Bridge.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>Pick 2: Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <emp>Manchester United or Draw</emp> @1.57</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Tottenham are missing their 1st choice goalkeeper and both starting centre-backs.</li>
                        <li>Tottenham struggled heavily against Rangers and although they scored 5 goals last time out,
                            it was against a pathetic Southampton team.</li>
                        <li>Mnachester United's previous game against Manchester City away was a perfect performance -
                            making it 2 wins out of 2 away games.</li>
                        <li>Tottenham allowed a bad Southampton team to have 9 shots with 3 on target and 42%
                            possession.</li>
                        <li>Amorim's counterattacking style meant United scored 2 goals from their 3 SOT against
                            Manchester City. This factor I believe that United will win this game, but double chance
                            takes into account the possibility of a draw as this is a cup game.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h4>Pick 3: Vitoria Guimaraes v Fiorentina</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <emp>Fiorentina or Draw</emp> @1.30</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The quality and standard of football in the Serie A is significantly greater than that in
                            Liga Portugal.</li>
                        <li>Vitoria and Fiorentina are at the top end of the table. Fiorentina have faced harder
                            opponents than Vitoria have.</li>
                        <li>Both teams have played St Gallen this campaign with Fiorentina winning 4-2 away from home
                            and Vitoria winning 4-1 away from home.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> I believe that this game will have lots of goal scoring chances and if you don't like the odds you
                    can get <emp>BTTS - YES</emp> at 1.57</li>

            <h5>Pick 4: Scott Williams v Niko Springer</h5>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <emp>Scott Williams to Win</emp> @1.67</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scott Williams had an excellent outing at the Players Championship Finals, reaching the QF
                            beating stellar oppenents: Jeff van de Graaf, Kim Huybrechts, and Gian van Veen. </li>
                        <li>Niko Springer is currently playing of the MODUS Super Series, which is a lower than the PDC
                            Tour.</li>
                        <li>Scott Williams is currently ranked 37th, while Niko Springer is ranked 157.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> With a 2nd round tie against Rob Cross up for grabs, this is Scott Williams' to lose.</li>

            <h6>Pick 5: Michael Smith v Kevin Doets</h6>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <emp>Michael Smith to WIN</emp> @1.25</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Kevin Doets had a nervy first round outing against Noa-Lynn van Leuven, losing the 1st set
                            in a 3-1 win.</li>
                        <li>Michael Smith has had a good year, earning the number 2 seed and has beaten Kevin Doets in
                            both of there recent meetings.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> I believe that the pressure of playing a high calibre opponent will be too much for Kevin Doets and
                    with Michael Smith not having the greatest run at the Players Championship Finals, expect a
                    comfortable Michael Smith win.</li>

            <h7>Pick 6: Los Angeles Chargers v Denver Broncos</h7>
            p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose <emp>Justin Herbert & Bo Nix 200+ Passing Yards Each</emp> @1.91</li>
                <li>Reasoning:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The LA Chargers will be looking to end their 2 match losing streak after an embarrasing
                            defeat to the Bucs last weekend.</li>
                        <li>Bo Nix has hit this line 80% this season, and will be looking to throw the ball with the LA
                            Chargers strong rush defense.</li>
                        <li>Justin Herbert has hit this line 70% this season and has key WR Ladd McConkey back from
                            injury.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> Although these two team have very good secondaries, I believe that both defenses will force the QBs
                    to throw the ball by plugging the gaps - stopping the rush offence from getting going.</li>
            </ul>
